iOS-APP-for-Heterogeneous-Embedded-Device
This device is optical signal DSP platform based on heterogeneous structure, which includes TI_OMAPL138 and Spartan_6_xc6slx9. The OMAP-L138 C6000 DSP+ARM processor is a low-power applications processor based on an ARM926EJ-S and a C674x DSP core. With the combination of FPGA+High speed ADC, this platform is capable of processing optical signal for different algorithms real timely. Meanwhile, a iOS app is developed to control the system wireless.
